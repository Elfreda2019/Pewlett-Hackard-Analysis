# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis.
Pewlett Hackard is a large company that has been around for a long time and now has its employee retiring at a rapid rate. They are looking towards the future in 2 ways:
1. First is to offer retirement package for those who met the criteria. 
2. And second is to start thinking about which positions to fill in the near future. 

Our task is to help the HR analyst build an employee database with SQL by applying our data modelling, engineering and analysis skills since Pewlett Hackard only has their employee data available in a form 6 csv files and have finally decided to update their method to use SQL instead.

This analysis will help Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for theb retirement package and the positions that needs to be filled
